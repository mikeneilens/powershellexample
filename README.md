This shows how to use powershell script to compare one CSV file (Database.txt) with another (Other.txt) and only write out records from the first CSV that has a matching key in the second CSV (written to out.csv).

To run the script copy files to a folder and use ./filtercsv.ps1 when in the folder in Powershell ISE command line.
